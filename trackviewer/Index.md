# GPX Track Viewer

GPX Track Viewer is a tiny and simple utility app that shows tracks from GPS Exchange Format (GPX) on a map along with short track information.

Internal file browser provides a way to organize GPX files from different sources and storages directly on a device.

'View Track' action allows viewing track file in any app that supports Share Sheet Actions without switching to the GPX Track Viewer.
